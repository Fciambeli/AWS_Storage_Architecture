## AWS Storage Architecture.

## Description

Here we will talk about storage efficiency using the following services: Bucket S3, Lambda and DynamoDB. ðŸ‘‡

Practical Scenario: Platform with Image Upload.

Imagine a platform where users upload photos in different formats (profile photos, scanned documents, etc.) to be displayed on the system. We want to ensure these images are at a standardized resolution to save on storage costs (480p) and also save money by removing temporary images that will no longer be used.

Architecture:

1 - Upload to Amazon S3: The user uploads the photo in any format to an S3 bucket (bucket-upload). This bucket acts as an entry point, accepting any image file.

2 - Processing with AWS Lambda: Upon receiving the image, S3 automatically triggers an event that triggers a Lambda function. This function resizes the image to 480p, saves the resized image in a second bucket (bucket-optimized), and stores upload information (metadata) in a DynamoDB table.

3 - Storage Savings: After processing, the Lambda function deletes the image from the upload bucket. This step ensures that only optimized images remain stored, reducing costs by automatically freeing up space on S3.

ðŸ’¥Benefits:

âœ”Storage Cost Optimization: Amazon S3 charges for occupied storage, so by deleting the original images, we achieve significant savings. In a scenario with thousands of daily uploads, this represents a significant reduction in monthly storage expenses.

âœ”Scalability: The entire architecture is serverless, that is, it automatically handles increases in the volume of uploads without the need for manual intervention or infrastructure overload.

âœ”Automated Processing: Lambda processes and stores images in seconds, without the need for a dedicated server, ensuring agility and performance.

âœ”Organization and Ease of Access to Metadata: DynamoDB stores the metadata of each image (image name, dimensions and upload date), facilitating access to this information and allowing simple integration with other applications.

Imagine that a high-resolution image takes up 5 MB of space. With a system that receives 10,000 images per month, temporary storage can easily exceed 50 GB. By automatically removing the original image after processing, the storage required is drastically reduced, ensuring long-term cost savings.ðŸ“ˆ

We also save on bucket-upload storage, since all images are in standard 480p and not in larger formats.

This architecture combines operational efficiency with savings in a practical and scalable solution. Using these services, companies can manage image processing in an agile and optimized way, reducing costs and maintenance time.
